1. Write a C++ program to calculate the grades of a list of students with attributes
(Name, Roll_no, Marks of 3 subjects) using class with member functions
input(), calcGrade(), display()
.
2. Write a C++ program to calculate the area of different shapes like Rectangle,
Square etc (at least 5 shapes) using overloaded function area().

3. Write a C++ program using classes to perform bank transaction for n customers
(cust_name, acc_no, acc_type, balance). The program should be menu driven
and it should have the following menus like adding new account, withdraw
(keep a min balance of 500), deposit, balance enquiry and account statement
(cust_name, acc_no, acc_type, balance).

4. Write a C++ progtram to perform operations such as compare, concatenate and
length on String objects.

5. Write a C++ program to demonstrate the order of execution of constructors &
destructors.

6. Create a class TIME with members hours, minutes, seconds. Take input, add
two time objects by passing objects to function and display result.

7. Write a C++ program to implement a class MATRIX with member functions such
as matrix_add, matrix_mult, matrix_transpose, matrix_determinant etc.

8. Write a program to perform addition of two complex numbers using constructor
overloading. The first constructor which takes no argument is used to create
objects which are not initialized, second which takes one argument is used to
initialize real and imag parts to equal values and third which takes two
argument is used to initialized real and imag to two different values.

9. Write a C++ program to design a class having static member function named
showcount() which has the property of displaying the number of objects created
of the class.

10. Write a C++ program using class to process shopping list for a Departmental
Store. The list include details such as the Code-no and price of each item and
perform the operations like adding & deleting items to the list and printing the
total value of an order.

11. Write a Program to swap private data members of classes named as class_1,
class_2 using friend function.

12. Write a Program to design a class complex to represent complex numbers. The
complex class should use an external function (use it as a friend function) to
add two complex numbers. The function should return an object of type
complex representing the sum of two complex numbers.
